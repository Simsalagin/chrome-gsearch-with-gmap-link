# Privacy Policy for Maps Button for Google Search

Last updated: November 7, 2024

## Overview
Maps Button for Google Search is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains our data collection and usage practices.

## Data Collection
**This extension does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data whatsoever.**

We do not collect:
- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Search queries
- Location data
- Any other user data

## What the Extension Does
The extension operates entirely locally in your browser and only:
- Reads the current Google Search page content to detect map results and business knowledge panels
- Adds a "Open in Google Maps" button to the page
- Reads the search query from the page URL to construct a Google Maps link when you click the button

All processing happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

## Permissions Explanation
The extension requires access to Google Search pages (`*.google.com/search*` and `*.google.de/search*`) to:
- Detect when maps or business panels are displayed
- Insert the Maps button into the page
- Read the search query to pass to Google Maps

These permissions are used solely for the extension's stated purpose and nothing else.

## Third-Party Services
The extension does not communicate with any third-party services or external servers. When you click the "Open in Google Maps" button, you are navigating directly to Google Maps (maps.google.com), which is subject to Google's own privacy policy.

## Data Sharing
Since we do not collect any data, we do not share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated "Last updated" date.
